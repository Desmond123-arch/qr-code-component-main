### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:
I learn't how to center divs and descendants both vertically and horizontally
```css
.center
{
    position: absolute;
    top:50%;
    left: 50%;
    transform: translate(-50%,-50%);
    padding: 10px;
}
```

### Continued development

Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.

I would like to focus mainly on improving the style and also adding in my own qr code generator.

### Useful resources

- [Centering divs](https://blog.hubspot.com/website/center-div-css) - This helped me to center divs. I really liked this explanations and will use it going forward.
- [Background images](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_images_background.asp) - This explained the concept of background images and how to style them to me. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
